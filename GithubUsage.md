#This is a github usage guild to make everyone synchronize and work with each other.
Basically you need to have your intelliJ project all have the same name as your Github repository which is "ZorkGame".  
To do so you need to clone the project from your Github web UI:
* step 1: you need to synchronize your intelliJ with your github account 
* step 2: open your intelliJ then you see the line "Get from version control"
* step 3: click on that line the you'll see the URL. Open github URL. http://yourGitHubName/ZorkGame. Copy and paste into the folder
* step 4: click ok then wait for it to finish clone the project
* step 5: when you make change you need to make a commit. click Ctrl + K for shortcut of commiting 
* step 6: put at least a message into the commit box 
* step 7: now you will need to push it back into the repository on web UI. Click ctrl + shift + K for shortcut or look on your top right corner you'll see the icon
Now we all have our project synchronize with each other.
